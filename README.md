# 📚 BookSwap
A community-based book exchange platform

## 📝 Description 

In this project, we’ve created a web app for book lovers to swap their favorite reads with others.

- We’ve built a search bar to easily find books, a map feature to show people nearest to you for swaps, and a My Swaps page where you can add and manage your books for swaps.

- The app displays books in a library-like layout with details like title, author, and summary.

- We’ve also added a login page where users can create an account, log in, and log out.

Features

- Search Bar: Find books quickly.

- Map Feature: See nearby users for swaps.

- My Swaps Page: Add and manage your books in a library-style layout.

- Login/Logout: Create an account and access your personalized library.

## 📲 How It’s Built

- The app uses React for the frontend, with components for each feature (search, map, My Swaps, and login).

 - The map feature integrates with an API to show nearby users.
Books added for swaps are saved using PostgreSQL Database, so your data stays even after logging out.

- The login page allows users to create accounts and log in/out.
